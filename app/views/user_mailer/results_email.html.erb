    <ul>
      <li>Perform each exercise for two minutes (1-minute per side when applicable)</li>
      <li>Do two exercises (exercise 1 + 2), twice per day (before & after training)</li>
      <li>Alternate which exercises you're doing daily (e.g. day 1 = toe touch exercises, day 2 = split squat exercises)</li>
      <li>These won't feel intense, that's OK. <%= link_to "Learn why here.", "https://bte-movement-app.herokuapp.com/about" %></li>
